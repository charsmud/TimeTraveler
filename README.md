TimeTraveler
============

This mod will have a few components:  Past Travel, Future Travel, and Paradoxes.  The first two are self-explanatory, as they allow you to travel to the past or future, respectively.  Paradox is a measure of how much you have done in the future or past.  The more that you do, the higher the bar will go, and more consequences will happen for your actions.  For example, killing some mobs will increase paradox more than others.  The same will happen with blocks:  dirt will give you less paradox than a diamond block.  So far, this mod is in development, but lots of information can be found at the mod's minecraftforum post.  ;)  I will occasionally release a pre-release version that is free for bug testing and mod reviewing.  :)
